- **Mood Tracking**: Detailed mood progression with trend analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Emotional word frequency, timing patterns, avoidance detection

### **Storage Services**
- **Primary**: Cloudflare D1 SQLite database (local development mode)
- **Analytics Processing**: Real-time pattern detection and storage
- **Data Flow**: User â†’ Daily Prompt â†’ Journal Entry â†’ Analytics Processing â†’ Pattern Storage

## Pattern Recognition System (Phase 1)

### **What MIM Currently Tracks:**
```javascript
// Behavioral Analytics
- Entry creation timing and frequency
- Time spent writing each entry  
- Mood ratings progression over time
- Vault access patterns and frequency
- Prompt engagement vs. skipping patterns

// Content Analytics  
- Emotional word frequency ("overwhelmed", "anxious", "grateful", etc.)
- Entry length and word count trends
- Response timing to different prompt categories
- Mood correlation with entry content

// Pattern Detection
- Weekly/monthly emotional cycles
- Trigger identification (what causes mood drops)
- Growth moment recognition (breakthrough language)
- Avoidance patterns (consistently skipped topics)
```

### **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:**
- **Journey Stats**: Total entries, active days, writing habits
- **Mood Insights**: Average mood, trend analysis, improvement tracking
- **Emotional Patterns**: Most-used emotional words with frequency
- **Growth Recognition**: Celebrates progress and breakthrough moments

## User Guide

### **Basic Reflection Flow:**
1. **Daily Check-in**: Get personalized prompt with your name
2. **Honest Writing**: Reflect freely with timer tracking writing time
3. **Mood Rating**: Rate your emotional state (1-5 scale)
4. **Pattern Recognition**: MIM automatically analyzes your entry for patterns
5. **Insights Access**: View your growth analytics in "Insights" tab

### **Analytics Features:**
- **Real-time Feedback**: See patterns as they develop
- **Privacy-First**: All analytics processed locally, never shared
- **Growth Tracking**: Visual progress over days, weeks, months
- **Pattern Awareness**: Spot cycles you couldn't see before

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Hono framework with TypeScript
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with comprehensive analytics schema
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with TailwindCSS
- **Analytics**: Real-time pattern detection and user behavior tracking
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (ready for production)
- **Development**: PM2 process manager with hot reload

## What's Next: AI-Powered Features (Phase 2)

### **Coming Soon (Phase 2 - Weeks 2-4):**
1. **Adaptive Prompting**: AI generates personalized prompts based on your patterns
2. **Cycle Interruption**: Real-time alerts when patterns are detected
3. **Breakthrough Recognition**: AI celebrates growth moments automatically
4. **Personalized Insights**: "Sarah, you've mentioned 'overwhelmed' 12 times this month..."
5. **Smart Timing**: Prompts delivered when you're most likely to engage

### **Pattern-Based Intelligence Example:**
```javascript
// What MIM will be able to do:
if (user.emotionalWords.overwhelmed >= 10 && user.moodTrend.declining) {
  generatePrompt("What boundary do you need to set, Sarah?");
}

if (user.skipPattern.includes("relationships") && user.mood > 3) {
  generatePrompt("How did you show up in your relationships today, Sarah?");  
}

if (user.breakthrough.detected) {
  celebrateGrowth("Sarah, this feels like a shift from how you talked about this last month!");
}
```

## Core Philosophy
MIM provides a **safe, private space** for honest self-reflection while intelligently learning from your patterns to accelerate emotional healing. Every interaction builds a deeper understanding of your emotional cycles, empowering you to break patterns that no longer serve you.

**The magic happens when technology meets psychology** - MIM becomes your emotional detective, spotting patterns you can't see from inside them, then asking exactly the right questions at exactly the right time.
