# 🤖 Mistral AI Integration Guide for Lyla

## 🎯 **What This Does:**
Makes Lyla 10x smarter! Instead of basic responses, she'll have real AI conversations that understand context, emotions, and provide thoughtful insights.

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Setup:**

### **Step 1: Get Mistral API Key**
1. Go to: `https://console.mistral.ai/`
2. **Sign up** for free account
3. Go to **"API Keys"** section  
4. **Create new key** - copy it (looks like: `mr-1234567890abcdef...`)
5. **Keep it secret!** - Never share this key

### **Step 2: Add Key to Cloudflare**
Since your app runs on Cloudflare Pages, add the key as a secret:

```bash
# In terminal/command prompt:
npx wrangler secret put MISTRAL_API_KEY --project-name YOUR_PROJECT_NAME

# When prompted, paste your Mistral API key
```

### **Step 3: Test Lyla's New Brain**
1. **Deploy your updated app** to Cloudflare Pages
2. **Visit your MIM app** at app.myinnermirror.app  
3. **Try talking to Lyla** - she should be much smarter!

## 🎭 **What Lyla Can Now Do:**

### **Before Mistral (Basic):**
- Simple pre-written responses
- No real understanding
- Generic replies

### **After Mistral (Intelligent):**
- ✅ **Understands context** - Remembers what you've shared
- ✅ **Emotional intelligence** - Recognizes your mood and responds appropriately  
- ✅ **Personalized insights** - Uses your onboarding data for custom advice
- ✅ **Natural conversation** - Flows like talking to a wise friend
- ✅ **Growth-focused** - Asks deeper questions to promote self-discovery

## 💰 **Cost:**
- **Mistral Medium**: $0.40 per 1M input tokens, $2.00 per 1M output tokens
- **Your usage**: Probably $1-5/month unless you have thousands of users
- **Much cheaper** than GPT-4 or Claude!

## 🚀 **Example Conversation:**

**User:** "I'm feeling really stressed about work lately"

**Lyla (Before):** "I'm here to listen. What's on your heart today?"

**Lyla (After):** "It sounds like work is weighing heavily on you right now. I remember from our earlier conversations that you're in a 'Building & Growing' life stage - work stress can feel especially intense when you're establishing your career. What specific aspect of work feels most overwhelming? Is it the workload, relationships with colleagues, or something else? Sometimes naming the exact source helps us see it more clearly."

## 🛠️ **Technical Details:**
- **Model**: `mistral-medium-latest` (best balance of cost/performance)
- **Max tokens**: 150 (keeps responses concise but thoughtful)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (creative but not random)
- **Fallback**: If API fails, Lyla still works with basic responses

## ✨ **Ready to Make Lyla Super Smart?**
Just get that API key and add it as a Cloudflare secret! Your users will have conversations with a truly intelligent Inner Mirror companion.
